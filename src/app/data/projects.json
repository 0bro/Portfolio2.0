I couldn’t get around why because the libraries provided Mac OS version. I was surprised to find that there weren’t many documentations on the solution online. So, I decided to research and create a detailed report on why it doesn’t work directly, and how to integrate you’re the libraries to work with Mac. This detailed report helped me better understand using C++, the libraries and VSCode."
